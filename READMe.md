# Dice Game ðŸŽ²

This is a simple Dice Game project where two players can roll a dice to see who scores higher. 

## How It Works

- Each time the **Roll dices** button is clicked, the `rollDice` function generates two random numbers between 1 and 6 (for each player).
- Each player's dice image updates based on their random roll.
- The game displays the winner (Player 1 or Player 2) or a "Draw!" message if both players roll the same number.
